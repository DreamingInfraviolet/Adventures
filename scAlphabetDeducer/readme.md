Given a set of unique characters, what's the best way to combine them
to replace existing letters to make the resulting alphabet as efficient
as possible in terms of letter mapping and combination?

This is the quest of this algorithm - given a letter specification,
it computes the best mapping that it can.

It does not give the best result possible, but gives a decent result
that can start as a base for designing your own alphabet.

It does not, however, generate the character symbols themselves. Instead,
these are specified by the user.
