Pretty much all drawing programs have the same limitation - a square canvas.
Often, however, one wishes creative space without being constrained by
boundaries, such as when doing creative sketching or just drawing down
ideas. This is why I have decided to create Larki, a boundless drawing
application. It works by dynamically creating "tiles" as the user draws,
and deleting them when the user erases.

What works:
* Zooming
* Panning
* Rendering
* Virtual pixel system, allowing painting
* Dynamic tile creation

What needs to be done:
* Refactoring
* Better UI
* Better brushes
* More efficient data structure to store the tiles
* Undo/redo
* Saving/loading
* Importing/Exporting normal images
* Erasing
