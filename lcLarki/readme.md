# Larki

This application was originally conceived as a tool for allowing infinite drawing in all directions, allowing artists
and scholars to experiment with sketches without being limited by an arbitrary square.

It has now been *discontinued*, due to me having discovered Mischief by The Foundry, which is a much better alternative :)
I'm just keeping it here for historical significance.
