/**
 * This class is used to refer to a grid of tiles. As
 * the real grid may contain holes and is composed of a multitude
 * of tiles, it can be inconvenient to do basic 2D pixel manipulation.
 * This class is meant to abstract the system, acting as a 2D array of
 * pixels while hiding the underlying implementation.
 * It's designed to be lightweight, and instantiation only exists to precompute some tasks.
 * Upon creation, it fills up any holes inside the rectangle. So only really use this if you're going to use most of the pixels inside it.
