# Adventures
A folder for many of my programming adventures, as I feel that I should start keeping them in a repository that's not private!

This is basically a sollection of smaller projects that I felt did not really need their own repository.
Many of these are not finished, but hopefully will become so ^_^

The projects are named according to a naming convention, which is described in NamingConventions.md

Most projects have a brief description of what they are, and a completion status.
